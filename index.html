    Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
    Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
    Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
    'Cause I'm feelin' so safe
    I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
    Oh, why don't we get out of town?
    Call me your baby, on the same wave
    Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down
    You and I, I
    Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

    I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
    Want you to take me for a ri-ide, ride
    When I hula-hula, hula
    So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
    There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
    We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

    Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
    Go ahead, explore the island
    Vibes so real that you can feel it in the air
    I'm revvin' up your engine
    I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
    Oh, why don't we get out of town? (Why don't we get out of town?)
    Call me your baby, catch the same wave
    Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down (let's go)
    You and I, I

    Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
    I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
    Want you to take me for a ri-ide, ride
    When I hula-hula, hula
    So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
    There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
    We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
    No, no

    You and I (you and I, I)
    Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
    I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
    Want you to take me for a ri-ide, ride
    When I hula-hula, hula
    So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
    There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
    We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
    I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
    Oh, whoa


    We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i
    Call me your baby, catch the same wave
    Oh, whoa
    We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i
